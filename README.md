The PartySimulation program is an interactive multi-threaded simulation written in the 
Java programming language. This simulation aims to model the dynamics of a real-world 
party, where guests consume various foods and drinks while a waiter works to keep these 
offerings continuously fresh. The multi-threading and synchronization mechanisms at the core 
of the program are excellent examples for understanding complex interactions and resource 
management in real-time systems. This simulation also serves as an indicator of how social 
interactions and human behaviors at a party can be emulated through technology.
